"""
You have an array A with N elements. We have 2 types of operation available on this array :
We can split a element B into 2 elements C and D such that B = C + D.
We can merge 2 elements P and Q as one element R such that R = P^Q i.e XOR of P and Q.
You have to determine whether it is possible to make array A containing only 1 element i.e. 0 after several splits and/or merge?
