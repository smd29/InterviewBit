"""
Given an array of integers A of size N denoting the fruits quality. A[i] denotes the fruit quality of the ith fruit.

Shivam needs to pick 4 fruits but he needs to pick them in such a way that his satisfaction value will be maximum.

If a, b, c and d are fruit quality of the 4 fruits picked then the satisfaction value(a, b, c, d) = (a & b & c & d) where & is bitwise AND operator.

Find the maximum satisfaction value Shivam can obtain.

Example Input

Input 1:

 A = [10, 20, 15, 4, 14]
Input 2:

 A = [2, 2, 7, 15]


Example Output

Output 1:

 4
Output 2:

 2


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 Shivam can pick fruits with fruits quality 20, 15, 4, 14 and satisfaction value is (20 & 15 & 4 & 15) = 4 
Explanation 2:

 Shivam will pick fruits with fruits quality 2, 2, 7, 15 and satisfaction value is(2 & 2 & 7 & 15) = 2
