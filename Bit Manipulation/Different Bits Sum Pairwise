"""
We define f(X, Y) as number of different corresponding bits in binary representation of X and Y.
For example, f(2, 7) = 2, since binary representation of 2 and 7 are 010 and 111, respectively. The first and the third bit differ, so f(2, 7) = 2.

You are given an array of N positive integers, A1, A2 ,..., AN. Find sum of f(Ai, Aj) for all pairs (i, j) such that 1 ≤ i, j ≤ N. Return the answer modulo 109+7.
