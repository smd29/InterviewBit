Problem Description

Given two integer array A and B of size N and M respectively. Your task is to find all the common elements in both the array.

NOTE:

Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
The result can be in any order.


Problem Constraints

1 <= N, M <= 105

1 <= A[i] <= 109



Input Format

First argument is an integer array A of size N.

Second argument is an integer array B of size M.



Output Format

Return an integer array denoting the common elements.



Example Input

Input 1:

 A = [1, 2, 2, 1]
 B = [2, 3, 1, 2]
Input 2:

 A = [2, 1, 4, 10]
 B = [3, 6, 2, 10, 10]


Example Output

Output 1:

 [1, 2, 2]
Output 2:

 [2, 10]


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 Elements (1, 2, 2) appears in both the array. Note 2 appears twice in both the array.
Explantion 2:

 Elements (2, 10) appears in both the array.
