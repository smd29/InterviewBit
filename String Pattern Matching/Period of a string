"""
Problem Description
You are given a string A of length N consisting of lowercase alphabets. Find the period of the string.

Period of the string is the minimum value of k (k >= 1), that satisfies A[i] = A[i % k] for all valid i.



Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 106



Input Format
First and only argument is a string A of length N.



Output Format
Return an integer, denoting the period of the string.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = "abababab"
Input 2:

 A = "aaaa"


Example Output
Output 1:

 2
Output 2:

 1


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 Period of the string will be 2: 
 Since, for all i, A[i] = A[i%2]. 
Explanation 2:

 Period of the string will be 1.
