"""
Little Ponny is given an array, A, of N integers. In a particular operation, he can set any element of the array equal to -1.

He wants your help for finding out the minimum number of operations required such that the maximum element of the resulting array is B. If it is not possible then return -1.

Input 1:

 A = [2, 4, 3, 1, 5]
 B = 3 
 
Output 1:

 2 
 
Explanation 1:

 We need to remove 4 and 5 to make 3 the biggest element.
