Problem Description

You are given a 2D integer matrix A, make all the elements in a row or column zero if the A[i][j] = 0. Specifically, make entire ith row and jth column zero.



Problem Constraints

1 <= A.size() <= 103

1 <= A[i].size() <= 103

0 <= A[i][j] <= 103



Input Format

First argument is a vector of vector of integers.(2D matrix).



Output Format

Return a vector of vector after doing required operations.



Example Input

Input 1:

[1,2,3,4]
[5,6,7,0]
[9,2,0,4]


Example Output

Output 1:

[1,2,0,0]
[0,0,0,0]
[0,0,0,0]


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

A[2][4] = A[3][3] = 0, so make 2nd row, 3rd row, 3rd column and 4th column zero.
